/*
 * Using the GNU gettext approach, compiled message catalogs are assemblies
 * containing just one class, a subclass of GettextResourceSet. They are thus
 * interoperable with standard ResourceManager based code.
 *
 * The main differences between the common .NET resources approach and the
 * GNU gettext approach are:
 * - In the .NET resource approach, the keys are abstract textual shortcuts.
 *   In the GNU gettext approach, the keys are the English/ASCII version
 *   of the messages.
 * - In the .NET resource approach, the translation files are called
 *   "Resource.locale.resx" and are UTF-8 encoded XML files. In the GNU gettext
 *   approach, the translation files are called "Resource.locale.po" and are
 *   in the encoding the translator has chosen. There are at least three GUI
 *   translating tools (Emacs PO mode, KDE KBabel, GNOME gtranslator).
 * - In the .NET resource approach, the function ResourceManager.GetString
 *   returns an empty string or throws an InvalidOperationException when no
 *   translation is found. In the GNU gettext approach, the GetString function
 *   returns the (English) message key in that case.
 * - In the .NET resource approach, there is no support for plural handling.
 *   In the GNU gettext approach, we have the GetPluralString function.
 * - In the .NET resource approach, there is no support for context specific
 *   translations.
 *   In the GNU gettext approach, we have the GetParticularString function.
 *
 * To compile GNU gettext message catalogs into C# assemblies, the msgfmt
 * program can be used.
